# Co-op Db - IN THE WORKS

This is not an open source project. It is a personal project which I am sharing over github. No PRs, no contributions.


cdb is a database system which I am writing for a local homeschool co-op. It is a Python-driven localhost web-app (I think thats the proper title), which uses a SQLite3 database, Python backend (with Flask), and a UI built with HTMX (we don't do CSS here). The end goal of this system is to replace the dysfunctional excel sheet which the co-op currently uses with a simple, practical, and reliable UI; cutting down the data work down from several hours a week to a couple minutes a month.
